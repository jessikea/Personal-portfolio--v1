# Project goal:

This project challenge involved developing a portfolio page for work samples with contact information. The goal was to make an organized page with multiple sections. Utilizating flex display options to compress and expand the page without ruining appearance and information. Working links in the navigation was implimented. Three main sections involve the header/about me, the works/projects, and the contact-me section.
